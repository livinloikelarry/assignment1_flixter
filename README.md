### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the labs were super helpful in getting this assignment done. However, I also felt that the demos Matt did, like the pokemon example, were especially helpful.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time I would've added some of the many cool features that I saw my other peers implement in their assignment such as
a hover effect that makes the poster image larger, the ability to move back to the top of the page by clicking the Flixter logo, and I would've had a nav bar instead of the title and header set up that I have now.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
  I noticed that Camila took a very logical approach to getting her assignement done. Next week I would like to think through the steps and implement features one by one. I felt that sometimes I was working on more than one thing at once and it was hard to keep track. I will also be asking more people about the features and logic of their code, or even reading their code if they feel comfortable sharing because I want to learn from others and get better at reading other's code. I hope that then teaches me how to make my own code more readable.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor: I want to give a shoutout to Diego, Nicholas, Camila, Marilyn, and Leo because they have all been super friendly and collaborated a lot with me. I want to give a shoutout to Matt for answering all of my questions and to Paige for bringing such good energy.
